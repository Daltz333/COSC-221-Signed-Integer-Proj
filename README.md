# Signed Integer Manipulation

This is an assignment for class COSC 221 at Eastern Michigan University

This assignment is meant to manipulate a -128 to 127 integer or 8 bit binary number to their respective binary or integer counterparts.

Outputs in:
- Signed Magnitude
- One's Compliment
- Two's Compliment
- Excess 128

Simply run this file with `python3 signed_integer_rep.py`. Note that this code requires Python 3 (I'm not sure how you call Python 3 on the EMU machines).

If the above command does not work:
- open Python 3 from the MacOS Spotlight (`Command` + `Space`)
- type `exec(open('/Users/username/signed_integer_rep.py').read())` where `/Users/username/signed_integer_rep.py` is the full path to the python file

3rd option:
- lastly, try double clicking on the file from finder. Images will be attached in the repo of some outputs
